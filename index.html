                <article>
                  <p>I was born and raised in Bali, specifically in Ubud. After graduating from Senior High School in Gianyar, I pursued a degree in Electrical Engineering at Telkom University, earning his bachelor's degree in 2019. In the same year, after graduating from Telkom University, I continued my studies at Institut Teknologi Bandung, focusing on control systems. I completed my Master's degree in 2022.</p>                
                  <p>I am an electrical engineer with a passion for technology, particularly in ocean-related technologies and robotics. I enjoy designing frameworks for robotic systems. I am also passionate about sports, including running, weightlifting, and scuba diving. I have an open water certification in scuba diving from ADS (Association of Diving School) International.</p>
                  <p>I have worked in marine conservation for two years. I am very open to invitations to join projects, especially those focused on preserving marine ecosystems. It would be even greater if I could implement my background in this field.</p>
